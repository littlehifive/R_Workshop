# Agenda

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to understand the following code:


```r
library(tidyverse)

dat &lt;- read_csv(here::here("data/RCT.csv"))

dat %&gt;%
  filter(age &lt;= 10) %&gt;%
  group_by(sch_id) %&gt;% 
  summarize(avg_scores = mean(std_scores)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(transformed_scores = as.numeric(scale(avg_scores))) %&gt;% 
  select(-avg_scores)
```

We'll be covering

- Basic R syntax
- Data loading
- Data inspection
- Data manipulation

# Stata vs. R ([_ref_](https://epirhandbook.com/en/transition-to-r.html))

| Stata | R |
|---|---|
| Stata is a proprietary, licensed software and can be expensive | R is open-source and free |
| Only one dataset can be in memory at a time | Multiple datasets can be manipulated and used simultaneously |
| Limited to built-in and user-created .ado files for extending functionality | A vast ecosystem of packages available through CRAN and GitHub |
| Graphic capabilities, while adequate, are not as flexible or customizable | Advanced graphical packages (e.g., ggplot2) offer high-quality and customizable visualizations |
| Stata's community, while active, is smaller and less diverse | Larger and more active user community leading to more resources, solutions, and online help |
| Limited advanced programming capabilities | Offers advanced programming constructs like functions, lists, and apply functions for better automation |

# Learning tools

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Grolemund and Wickham

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4) (especially GPT4)

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

- There is usually an R book for almost everything (see [here](https://github.com/maxto/R-Books)).

---

# Type of R files

### R Projects (.Rproj)

- Organize work in a structured manner with relative path.
- Provide a dedicated workspace for each project.

### R Script (.R)

- Plain text files containing R code.
- Executed directly or sourced within other scripts or documents.

### R Markdown (.Rmd)

- Combine R code, text, and output.
- Create dynamic documents.

--

**We will talk about data workflow management in a future workshop.**

**Let's try to create these files by hand!**

# Loading your data

## 🗄➡ 💻

---

## Understanding R syntax

R is built around **functions**, bits of atomic code that accept inputs and return an output.

--

A function looks like this:


```r
function_name(argument_1, argument_2, parameter = TRUE)
```

--

Functions can be bundled together and shared using **packages**. To access a function from a specific package, we use the `::` operator.


```r
package.name::function_name(argument_1, argument_2, parameter = TRUE)
```

---

## Understanding R syntax

--

It may be cumbersome to write `::` each time you use a function. Therefore, R allows you to load those packages in your current session using the `library()` function so you can just refer to the function name without `::`.

--


```r
library(package.name)

# Refers to `function_name` in `package.name`
function_name(argument_1, argument_2, parameter = TRUE)
```

--

In Stata, this would be similar to:

```
// function_name argument_1 argument_2, parameter 1
```
--

For instance,


```stata
# Stata code
gen new_var = old_var * 2
```


```r
# R code
df &lt;- dplyr::mutate(df, new_var = old_var * 2)
```


---

# Tools for loading data

While there are lots of options, I recommend loading data using the following functions:


```r
readr::read_csv("data.csv")
haven::read_dta("data.dta")
openxlsx::read.xlsx("data.xlsx")
```

**readr** and **haven** are both part of the "_tidyverse_", a bundle of packages that contain the most essential functions for data wrangling.

**openxlsx** is a standalone package that deals with reading and writing Excel files.

--

In Stata, the equivalent commands are:


```stata
import delimited using "data.csv"
use "data.dta"
import excel using "data.xlsx", firstrow

```


---


# Tools for loading data

--

Some packages come with the installation of R, some don't. This is because R is an open-source software, and anyone in the world can contribute their packages to the R community.

--

To use these packages, you need to install them first by running `install.packages("package.name")`:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("haven")
```

**Note:** Only run these commands **once**. Once they're installed, you don't need to run that command again since the package will be on your computer.

---

# Finding help on packages

R packages are typically published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) (The Comprehensive R Archive Network).

Developer versions of R packages are typically published on GitHub (for instance, [`readr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr)).

When you encounter a function that you don't know or understand for some reason, **consult the R help system**!

--


```r
# search help doc for a package
?readr

# search help doc for a function in a package
?readr::read_csv

# If you're not certain what a function name is or you're looking for a certain topic, use `??` (think: "wildcard search") followed by the topic name
??readr::read_table
```

---


# Let's load our data!

The simulated RCT dataset is located in the `data` directory (folder) at the root of this project. I'll use the **here** package to create paths that are _relative to the project root_.

--

I'll attach the packages we need for now:


```r
library(readr)
library(here)
```

```
## here() starts at /Users/michaelfive/Desktop/R Directory/R_Workshop
```

Note how **here** tells us where it thinks the project root is! It recursively searches upward for a directory with a `DESCRIPTION` or `.Rproj` file. 

**here** is very handy utility for reproducibility since it _localizes_ paths to the project -- and not expanding to the full path on _your_ computer.

---

# Let's load our data!

Time to load the data:


```r
dat &lt;- read_csv(here("data/RCT.csv"))
```

```

## Two things to note

.pull-left[

R uses the `&lt;-` operator to _assign_ values to symbols (variables). 


```r
x &lt;- (1+1) * 2^3 / 4 - 2
```

In our data's case, the results of reading the CSV file are assigned to the `dat` symbol.

In STATA, the closest action is to generate a variable called `x` in the current dataset. But what the R code does is to create x as a vector of 1 instead of a data frame.


```stata
# Stata code
gen x = (1+1) * 2^3 / 4 - 2
```


]

.pull-right[

Unlike Stata, you can have multiple data frames in one R session.


```r
dat1 &lt;- dat
dat2 &lt;- dat
```

This is very helpful in cross-checking and merging datasets, as well as interacting with various R objects (e.g., vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, etc.).

]

---

# Looking at our data

After loading our data, it's useful to high-level view of its content to make sure that it loaded correctly.

We'll use the `str()` and `print()` functions here, both part of base R.

---

# Looking at our data




```r
str(dat)
```

```
## spc_tbl_ [1,000 × 6] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ sch_id    : num [1:1000] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ st_id     : num [1:1000] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ treated   : num [1:1000] 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 ...
##  $ age       : num [1:1000] 8 10 12 7 11 11 9 9 9 9 ...
##  $ female    : num [1:1000] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ...
##  $ std_scores: num [1:1000] -0.159 -0.578 -0.807 0.163 -0.621 ...
##  - attr(*, "problems")=&lt;externalptr&gt;
```

```r
class(dat)
```

```
## [1] "spec_tbl_df" "tbl_df"      "tbl"         "data.frame"
```

---

# Looking at our data

The _class_ of this `dat` object is a `data.frame`. `data.frame`s are R's representation of tabular data. `dat` is also a `tbl_df` ("tibble"), which is the Tidyverse's version of a `data.frame` that is a little bit more stringent (i.e. safe) than base R's version, and it has a prettier `print()` method:


```r
print(dat)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,000 × 6
##    sch_id st_id treated   age female std_scores
##     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1      1     1       0     8      0     -0.159
##  2      1     2       1    10      0     -0.578
##  3      1     3       0    12      0     -0.807
##  4      1     4       1     7      0      0.163
##  5      1     5       1    11      0     -0.621
##  6      1     6       1    11      0     -0.643
##  7      1     7       0     9      0     -0.337

# Looking at our data

If you'd like to see _all_ of your data in a pretty Excel-like spreadsheet, use the `View()` function which has a great display in RStudio.


```r
View(dat)
```

Note: Or you can click on the data frame in the Environment tab. Or hold command/ctrl and click `dat` on the R script.

---

# Data types in R

You may have noticed a bunch of three-letter abbreviations next to the variable names in `print(dat)` and the variable content in `str(dat)`. These are the _type signatures_ for each variable:

- Double (`dbl` / `num`): All real numbers, like `\(50\)`, `\(23.193\)`, or `\(1.24\times10^{-8}\)`
- Character (`chr`): Text/strings, written with single- or double-quotes (e.g. `"a string"`)

There are a couple more that you will encounter regularly:

- Integer (`int`): Integers and counting numbers. No decimals and scientific notation here!
- Logical (`lgl`): Boolean data, written as `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- Factor (`fct`): Factors, R's representation of categorical data. They look like character data with `print()`, but under the hood they are integers. These should only exist in cleaned, ready-for-analysis data!

# Working with your data

What we'll be discussing today is basic *data wrangling*.

&gt; Data wrangling (n.): The process of transforming data from one raw form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;mdash;Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt;

---

# Basic Data Wrangling

Most data wrangling comes down to **five** basic operations:

- **Selecting**: Selecting or deselcting variables 
- **Filtering**: Filtering by row
- **Arranging**: Reordering by variables
- **Summarizing**: Aggregating data for summary statistics
- **Mutating**: Creating, editing, or deleting variables

You can also **Group** these operations by variables. For example, finding the average math score in each class would be achieved by _grouping_ by class and then _summarizing_ by taking the mean.

---

# Basic Data Wrangling

In this workshop, **we recommend using the dplyr package in tidyverse**, but we can also achieve the same thing in base R:

.font12[

| Operation   |                                       Tidyverse |                                    Base R       |
|:------------|------------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------:|
| Selecting   | `select(dat, treated)`                          | `dat[,"treated"]`                               |
| Filtering   | `filter(dat, treated == 1)`                     | `dat[dat$treated == 1", ]`                      |
| Arranging   | `arrange(dat, std_scores)`                      | `dat[order(dat$std_scores), ]`                  |
| Summarizing | `summarize(dat, avg_scores = mean(std_scores))` | `data.frame(avg_scores = mean(dat$std_scores))` |
| Mutating    | `mutate(dat, failed = std_scores &lt; 0)`          | `dat$failed &lt;- dat$std_scores &lt; 0`              |

]

It's  apparent that tidyverse has a much more consistent and readable syntax than base R.

--

The equivalent commands in Stata are:

.font10[


```stata
keep treated
keep if treated == 1
sort std_scores
collapse (mean) avg_scores = std_scores
gen failed = std_scores &lt; 0
```
]

---

# Basic Data Wrangling

All of these tidyverse functions are provided by the **dplyr** package.


```r
library(dplyr)
```

---

## Selecting

Selects or deselects one or multiple variables.


```r
select(dat, treated)
```


```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   treated
##     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1       0
```


```r
select(dat, -treated)
```


```
## # A tibble: 1 × 5
##   sch_id st_id   age female std_scores
##    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      1     1     8      0     -0.159
```


```r
select(dat, sch_id:female)
```


```
## # A tibble: 1 × 5
##   sch_id st_id treated   age female
##    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      1     1       0     8      0
```
---

## Filtering

Looks for rows with a provided comparison, usually with `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`, or `==` (note: two equals!).


```r
filter(dat, treated == 1)
```

```
## # A tibble: 499 × 6
##    sch_id st_id treated   age female std_scores
##     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1      1     2       1    10      0     -0.578
##  2      1     4       1     7      0      0.163
##  3      1     5       1    11      0     -0.621
##  4      1     6       1    11      0     -0.643
##  5      1     8       1     9      0     -0.345
##  6      1     9       1     9      1      0.160
##  7      1    10       1     9      0     -0.248
##  8      1    11       1     9      0     -0.365
##  9      1    13       1     9      1      0.220
## 10      1    15       1    11      0     -0.771
## # ℹ 489 more rows
```

**Homework: Figure out how to choose row-wise those with age greater than the average age.**

---

## Arranging

Sorts a dataset by a `variable` in _ascending_ order with `arrange(dat, variable)`.


```r
arrange(dat, std_scores)
```


```
## # A tibble: 6 × 6
##   sch_id st_id treated   age female std_scores
##    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      5   486       1    15      0      -1.40

## Summarizing

Calculate some summary function on variables, like `mean()`, `median()`, or `sd()`:


```r
summarize(
  dat, 
  avg_score = mean(std_scores), 
  sd_score = sd(std_scores)
)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   avg_score sd_score
##       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1    -0.352    0.357
```

**Homework: Is there a difference between summarize() and summarise()?**

---

## Mutating

Create, edit, or delete variables in a dataset.


```r
mutate(
  dat,
  # Changes condition to an index variable with character values
  condition = ifelse(treated == 1, "Treatment", "Control")
)
```


```
## # A tibble: 2 × 7
##   sch_id st_id treated   age female std_scores condition
##    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    
## 1      1     1       0     8      0     -0.159 Control  
## 2      1     2       1    10      0     -0.578 Treatment
```

**Homework: Create a variable in `dat` called age_gt_10, which takes the value of 1 when age &gt; 10, otherwise 0.**

# ⚠️
## Tidyverse Caution!
]

The tidyverse (mainly **dplyr**, but a couple other packages) refers to variables in datasets with "naked" symbols.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;





.footnote[
[1]: In computer science lingo, these are technically called _quoted symbols_, but that can be confusing.
]

---

.center[
# ⚠️
## Tidyverse Caution!
]

But _outside_ of the tidyverse functions, these variables **are not defined**.


```r
mean(std_scores)
```

```
## Error in mean(std_scores): object 'std_scores' not found
```

---

.center[
# ⚠️
## Tidyverse Caution!
]

To access dataset variables outside of tidyverse functions, you must use the **`$`** ("extract") operator in conjunction with the symbol for the parent dataset.





Just keep this in mind!

---

# Combining Operations

These "verbs" (as **dplyr** likes to call them) are **composable** meaning you can chain these commands together, allowing you to create complex data transformations or summaries all in one step.


```r
summarize(
  filter(dat, treated == 1), 
  avg_score = mean(std_scores)
)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   avg_score
##       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1    -0.347
```

--

This is ugly. Thankfully, there is a better way of chaining these steps together!

## The Pipe!

# `%&gt;%`

]

--

The pipe `%&gt;%` is an operator provided by **magrittr**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; that makes writing nested functions _much_ easier.

The shortcut is `command + shift + M` on Mac, or `ctrl + shift + M` on Windows.

.footnote[
[1]: Starting from R 4.1.0, there is the native pipe |&gt; in R, which does the same thing without loading `tidyverse`.
]

---

## The Pipe

Instead of writing

```r
h(g(f(x)))
```

you can write

```r
x %&gt;% 
  f() %&gt;% 
  g() %&gt;% 
  h()
```

--

The pipe works by inserting the result of the left hand side into the **first argument** of the right hand side.

---

# Combining Operations

Revisiting our first chained example,


```r
summarize(
  filter(dat, treated == 1), 
  avg_scores = mean(std_scores)
)
```

we can now use


```r
dat %&gt;% 
  filter(treated == 1) %&gt;% 
  summarize(avg_scores = mean(std_scores))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   avg_scores
##        &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     -0.347
```

---

## Grouping

Now let's add grouping into the mix, which you can easily do with `group_by(variable)`:


```r
dat %&gt;% 
  group_by(treated) %&gt;% 
  summarize(avg_scores = mean(std_scores))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 2
##   treated avg_scores
##     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1       0     -0.357
## 2       1     -0.347
```

---

## Grouping

You can group by multiple variables as well. Just add more variables to `group_by()`:


```r
dat %&gt;% 
* group_by(treated, female) %&gt;% 
  summarize(avg_scores = mean(std_scores))
```


```
## # A tibble: 4 × 3
## # Groups:   treated [2]
##   treated female avg_scores
##     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1       0      0    -0.504 
## 2       0      1     0.0169
## 3       1      0    -0.473 
## 4       1      1    -0.0218
```

## Bonus Point

**You can do Tableau-style plots in R using just one command:**


```r
install.packages("esquisse")
library(esquisse)

# Open Tableau-like dashboard in Rstudio
esquisser()
```

**Note: We can talk about summary statistics and visualization in a future workshop.**

# Exercise

Use the functions you learned to answer the following question:

1. What is the average age for boys and girls?
2. Which `st_id` is the oldest students in school 8?
3. Which age group has the most number of students?
4. What is the average `std_scores` for girls aged 7 or 8 in the treatment group?
5. Create a data.frame with the name `dat_s` with the following rules:
- Deselect `st_id`
- Filter out students younger than 10 years old
- Create a new variable called `transformed_scores` and assign it the value of 99 times the `std_scores` if age &gt;= 10, else assign it the value 101 times the `std_scores`

.footnote[

Consider using the `|` (read: **or**) operator to combine multiple filter statements into one (e.g. filtering for `this` or `that` would be `filter(dat, this | that)`).
